However, after a brief recorded message suggesting a visit to the website the line dropped (twice). I then made contact through a bot on the website which eventually reported that the message would be passed on.This morning I received an email from SuperValu apologising for a ' a miscommunication within our department' and asking what time would suit for delivery and offering a refund of the €7 delivery charge.  As I happened to be home this morning I requested 11-12.  The delivery arrived well after 12 and I noted from their delivery note that the original time of 5-7 pm had been changed to 12-2 pm today!!The baguette and scones included in the order were intended for a person who is ill but had to be discarded due to the fact that they were not fresh.

Several times, there's been no staff around these machines to help.I've had issues processing my card where the machine emits deafening beep sound that are audible all around the store!! very embarrassing!!Second issue is their price labelling. Price labels are mixed up, obscurely labelled and unclear.For example a 2euro price tag below 6 euro items.The 2 and 6 euro tags are for the same pizza brand have almost identical descriptions.This is an issue all across the store, and I feel it's done intentionally as a tactic to get customers to inadvertently purchase more expensive items...How difficult is it to align the price tags with the correct products??",2025-09-22 12:53:05+00:00,3.0,0.082,0.874,0.044,-0.68,SuperValu

It’s frustrating when the shelf price doesn’t match what you’re charged. Something to watch out for.However, I was recently disappointed when I purchased a leek and cheese sandwich filler. When I got home, I noticed the seal was broken, and it looked like someone may have already taken a spoonful out of it.

"My daughter and I did a big shop today in our local SuperValu in Ranelagh. Despite it being quite small, dingy and badly stocked, it’s our local supermarket (compare with the nice SV in Rathgar!). We used the self service till to pay for our groceries. The self service machine kept stopping saying that there was an “unexpected item in the bagging area.” This happened about 5-6 times. A man at the next till commiserated and told me he’d experienced the same malfunctioning tills at SV before. I looked for a store assistant to help. My daughter was at the till. The sales assistant waved her card at the machine, which solved the problem, but turned to my daughter and hissed, “I don’t know what the problem is, there is no problem, it’s working,” in a very rude and abrupt manner. My daughter is 21 years old, but she was quite shaken by being ridiculed. My daughter and I had been scanning our groceries together, I was witness to the decrepit faulty machine and I also witnessed the incredible behaviour of the so called “sales assistant.” Her job description is in the title of her job! She is there to assist. I don’t think the so called “sales assistant” realised that my daughter and I were together. My daughter is adopted and has dark skin. I felt there was an element of racism in her treatment of my daughter which utterly shocked me, I doubt very much she would have dared to speak to me in the same sneering tone of voice. Having said  that, at around 4:30pm the shop seemed severely understaffed. A different sales assistant was on her hands and knees trying to repair one of the self service tills, and there seemed to be no one manning the cash registers. It shows very poor management skills that the checkout section of a busy urban grocery store should be so understaffed during peak times. However, NOTHING legitimises a sales assistant sneering at and being rude to a customer. I promise that I will take the almost €100 I spent today at SV to Dunnes just up the street for our next shop.",2025-02-12 01:25:23+00:00,1.0,0.125,0.847,0.028,-0.991,SuperValu

SuperValu Sutton is wholly owned by the Cork based wholesaler Musgraves. How this store has deteriorated since it was once a flagship in the Superquinn Group. Long gone is the excellent customer service and superior range that the well heeled clientele of Sutton and Howth might expect on their doorsteps. Now it feels more like a giant convenience store, run as if on a shoestring budget by a management team who know the margin on a tin of beans down to the nearest bitcoin! Frequently out of stock even on domestic lines, incorrect pricing combined with shelf labels not legible to anyone over 50 (about half their customers!), automatic tills that shut down along with the tobacco/booze/lottery counter about 45 mins before closing time are among the many gripesI If you need a quick basket of goods, do drop in.

"5 starsfor supervalu my reasons being1) te company is competing with the likes of tesco and lidl struggling to get the same level of service, purchasing zbility at the same prices as the larger multi national competitors.2) the customer service is there with onlinehelp at supervalu ie  as well as direct phonecall (i obtained full refund for 2 7.5kg bags of potatoes and a posh tin of dog food i didn't order, numbers were mixed up, issue with order processing possibly). it was resolved without any issues whatsoever as well as the delivery driver stating the same at point of delivery, (i just re iterated my point at phonecall).i also suggested an alternative dry dog food manufacturer regarding short supply of the 10kg bags of bulk currently out of stock.3) The meat counter is regularly low on stock, out of stock on products.this may be because of restricted supply due to better deals offered to suppliers, farmers, producers ect  by the above and other larger miltinational companies of which musgrave cannot compete, struggle to match to summarise, i cannot see supervalu continuing at the level they are currently at unless they adapt (become a discount chain like fultons foods, heron foods ect go down the route of farmfoods and similar in house companies, supply in and at customer end in house, B&M, Home Bargains ect.... the plus side being delivery is available with supervalu where it is clearly missing regarding thelikes of lidl, aldi which are both very good stores in their own right offering value for money or they can cash in and sell to a multinational chain such as wallmart as ASDA Leeds did many years ago but then gone will be the greengrocer, the bitcher, the baker, the candlestick maker in favour of cheap mass production foods and a future of soylent green...... possibly???",2024-10-21 09:34:01+00:00,5.0,0.021,0.908,0.071,0.8949,SuperValu

Terrible online customer service. Up there with the worst. Sent an enquiry and never got a response - despite my interest in one of their products. They clearly don’t need the business. Sent a second online enquiry two weeks later and did get a response but whoever was at the other end decided they couldn’t be bothered anymore - that was mid conversation. I was still waiting but gave up looking after four hours. I doubt very much anyone from Avoca will reply to this as it appears they can’t even be bothered to read the reviews - let alone respond to them. Do not buy from them. Spend your money elsewhere. There are plenty of Irish online companies who I’m sure would love your business and will probably be happy to converse with you if necessary.

"I am in UK. I bought a raincoat in good faith from Avoca Online - the Avoca website stated that duty/taxes were included.   UPS added £45, refused to deliver unless I paid. Avoca assured me it was their mistake and would be dealt with - but this didn't happen. I paid the duty and eventually UPS delivered it but the garment did not fit, so I returned it immediately - in pristine condition - did all the correct things, Royal Mail paid, tracked and signed.  No response. Nothing. No refund either for goods or for tax erroneously paid. It is now mid February and despite numerous contacts with, and assurances from Avoca customer service, the reality is they have been no help, they have my money and I have received no reimbursement.I am editing this as I would like to add that the person I spoke to on the phone was very pleasant and sympathetic - but following my phone calls there was no practical response.

"My husband and myself went to Avoca Rathcoole to have lunch today May 5, 2023 between 2-3pm. When I went to order our desserts, I was alone in the cake area and no staff came to assist me eventho’ there are 2 staff in the area and they already saw me. There was no other customer but me at that time and it was not busy at all. As I said, there are 2 staffs who were there (one in cashier with long hair in pony tail)   and the other one ( with boy cut hair with curly hair on top with a streak on her hair) putting the small pieces of butter in packets  beside the cashier. They are talking to each other as if they are having a row. The curly hair asked me to go to the cashier because people are coming to queue in and said she will get my cakes and she will give it in the cashier area. She gave me my cake order but I am still waiting for my 1 order of cappuccino. Since I am still waiting for my cappuccino, I let the 2 woman behind me to go first to pay. It was only 1 CAPPUCCINO that i was waiting and I was surprised that they gave 2 cappuccino with the man behind me and did not even gave me 1 cappuccino first, since I was there for ages and I was there before the man.Before that happened, while I was waiting for my coffee, I saw the curly hair told the pony tail woman to make 1 cappuccino for me but she ignored it because they are having a row! So I was the one who was affected! When I complained and asked where is my coffee and why that old man was served first since I was there before him. The old man who owns the 2 cappuccino who was served first before me have argued with me and told me that he was there before me and said I have no manners! I told him to ask the curly hair that I was there before him and just let his wife to go before me because I was just waiting for my coffee. The curly hair cannot answer because she knows I was there before him.I just would like to say that customers are affected when your staff are having a row. The curly hair did not make my coffee and asked the pony tail to make it (which she did not) and made the 2 cappuccino coffee for the old man instead and let me wait even I ordered first before that old man! I only ordered 1 cappuccino coffee and she only made 2 cappuccino coffee for that old man!  The pony tail woman should have given me 1 of those coffee that she made first so that I can go already because I was there before that old man and I was there for ages.And by the way, we were charged €19.60 for 2 slices of cakes and 1 cappuccino!

"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE I EVER FOUND AFTER 25 YEARS ON THE INTERNET FOR CHOCOLATES.If you are in the UK be careful to make sure your url does not end in ,ie as that is the irish site and it's international so it will take a wee bit longer but it's still fast! If you want next day delivery make sure your url ends in .co.uk and prices should be in ££££'s.Fantastic delicious chocolates and compared to others the price is excellent. These are REAL chocolatier chocs so they only have a few months shelve life but I assure you once you try them they will easily be gone very quickly and long before the expiry date. Packaging is great as is the excellent customer service. Look out for the genuine discounts too and you might even get a voucher in your package for future savings! I bought 3 boxes for the hospital staff that looked after me after a recent illness and Chloe went out of her way to get them to me in time as they had to be shipped from Ireland due to stock being low in the uk,and got to me within 72 hours and that included a weekend.
